# `Belsac - A Fashion Bag Store`
**Built with Shopify `Storefront API` and `NEXT.js`**.

This store was built with a tutorial explaining the workings behind it. `Crude` enough to show how nonproduction ready it is but at the same time `elegant` enough to capture the most important aspects of developing an online store.

Every branch in this repository was built **`beginner-friendly`**

## The Tutorial
The development process, including the frontend development was properly detailed in the tutorial. The tutorial is divided into seven (7) sections for easier step-wise understanding of how everything comes together to produce the perfect product.
